## Adjustments made by Megan Yates for CS1520 Programming Languages for Web Applications

Part Two - Matt Bowytz University of Pittsburgh Spring 2016

One page or multi page layout. Minimum of three sections/pages

You may use a frontend framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation. You may also use a template, all I ask is that
you do not use it as it comes. Add your own layer of style on top of what is included.

All pages (views and includes, etc) should be written in PHP, at least for this first part of the project

One component/page of your site should be a contact form, I would prefer this to submit to a database, but if you
want to defer the database and have it email you or write to a text file, that is ok too.

Programming Requirements:
Intelligent use of topics covered in class so far. Such as:
Use of variables, includes, arrays, functions, file reading etc.

There are no hard requirements for what PHP to use and when. The best approach would be to use as many of the
topics covered in class (appropriately) as necessary to make the site work and prove your ability
