## Adjustments made by Megan Yates for CS1520 Programming Languages for Web Applications

Part Two - Matt Bowytz University of Pittsburgh Spring 2016

First and foremost, the changes must be significant and/or meaningful. Meaning that changing a few lines of code, or changing some variables will not be enough to count as a qualified submission

JS or jQuery must be used in some way for the second part of the project
If you do not know how to, or cannot think of a way to do this ask the TA or myself for advice

This is still going to be a php project, so taking everything out of php and putting it in html files will not be acceptable
You can incorporate an API, create form submissions without reloading the page, etc.

If you, for some reason, did not have some kind of database finctionality n part 1, you must include that in part 2
If you did not make db functionality for part 1, you must demonstrate the functionality to me on the day it is due

The required amount of pages has not changed, however if you want to include more pages, that is fine with me, but don'g go overboard
If you were lacking in actual content for part 1, take this opporunity to put meaningful site content into the project

Since we've gone over more CSS and HTML and things like that, you may want to refresh your site viaually. Make things look a little better, make the layout easier on the eyes, etc.
It shouldn't take you as long to do part 2, unless your first iteration was lacking

Part One

One page or multi page layout. Minimum of three sections/pages

You may use a frontend framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation. You may also use a template, all I ask is that
you do not use it as it comes. Add your own layer of style on top of what is included.

All pages (views and includes, etc) should be written in PHP, at least for this first part of the project

One component/page of your site should be a contact form, I would prefer this to submit to a database, but if you
want to defer the database and have it email you or write to a text file, that is ok too.

Programming Requirements:
Intelligent use of topics covered in class so far. Such as:
Use of variables, includes, arrays, functions, file reading etc.

There are no hard requirements for what PHP to use and when. The best approach would be to use as many of the
topics covered in class (appropriately) as necessary to make the site work and prove your ability
